# Diece-Game
This repository marks my journey in web development under the mentorship of Dr. Angela Yu. As part of the course, I've crafted a simple yet interactive Dice Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a hands-on representation of my learning progress. Feel free to roll the dice and explore the code! Grateful for Dr. Angela Yu's guidance, this project is a testament to the practical skills gained in the course. Let the coding adventure continue!
